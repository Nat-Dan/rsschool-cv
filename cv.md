- **My previous professional experience** is related to the field of Client Consultancy in Fashion Industry. I achieved it working in Rome (9 years) and London (2 years) in premium boutiques and high-street brands (e.g.: Alberre Odette, Massimo Dutti, Eredi Pisano'). This helped me to gain knowledge of multicultural customer's psychology by matching the customer's needs to the right product. Moreover, such experience highly improved my skills of Italian and English languages. I have also experience in design and creation of different products, related to clothing and accessories.
